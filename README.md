```
npm run benchmarking
```
The resulting statistics are written to CSV files in the ```benchmarking-results``` directory.

### Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, execute
```
npm run testing
```
An overview of the passed an failed test cases is shown.

### Translator
The Translator can be used by running
```

The off-chained contract is written to the ```translator-output``` directory.
