\chapter{Evaluation} 

In this section, we are going to discuss how our evaluation was conducted.
We automatized the benchmarking, therefore, our benchmarks are repeatable and easy to execute.
The findings we made will also be discussed.

As already mentioned this project was carried out as a prototyping project.
Therefore, we need to benchmark our results against the current best practice.
Current state of the art for deploying contracts to the Ethereum blockchain includes saving all the state variables of the contract on the blockchain and thus, on all machines participating in the blockchain.
As proposed we want to save those state variables off of the blockchain and thus, save on gas which explains why gas costs are our most important measurement.
