\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:approach-implementation}

In this section we aim to showcase all of the design decisions that we, as a team, have made in the implementation. The goal of this section is to also provide the implementation details of the steps in our application flow. We will also include the technologies that have also helped us achieve our goals in the current implementation. We hope that the readers will have a good understanding of the mechanisms, techniques and technologies we used to implement our off-chaining approach.
