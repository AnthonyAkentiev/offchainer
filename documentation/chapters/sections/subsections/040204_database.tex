In the scope of this project, a relational database is used for storing and retrieving the off-chained data from our client side application. We decided to use PostgreSQL as an open source and highly scalable object-relational database system. \cite{relatedWork35}. And as mentioned previously, we used a third party library to connect the database with the client side application. The client side application interacts with the database when it needs to store data, such root hashes, as seen in our application flow. In addition to that, the database also allows the client side application to insert filters and specify order when querying data.
