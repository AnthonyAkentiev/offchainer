\subsection{Hashing}
\subsection{Merkle Tree}

With regards to storing data effectively and securely, Merkle trees is the most known approach of solving this type of issues. A hash tree is the also known as Merkle tree. It is usually implied for verifying any data stored and transmitted in and between various nodes (computers) on a network. To be more exact, a Merkle tree is intended to guarantee blocks of data that can be received from different peers in a distributed peer-to-peer network. Consequently, this data should be in its original state, without adjustments or corrupted data.\\
Merkle tree contains child nodes under every node on the network. This approach was initially introduced, despite the fact that it needs future developments and improvements on the approach. In reality, there is no limit with respect to what number of child nodes can be utilized per node to build up a more secure Merkle tree.\\
