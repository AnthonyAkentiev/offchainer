Smart contracts are increasingly used in various domains as they enable credible computations without the need for a trusted third party.
In order to ensure trustless properties, computations and storage have to be distributed on a large network of nodes, which makes it expensive to use more than a few hundred bytes of data in smart contract computations.
In this report, we explore possibilities to \emph{off-chain} smart contract data, i.e., storing it outside the blockchain without compromising the data integrity.
We present a system which leverages cryptographic proofs to store the state variables of a smart contract in an untrusted relational database, while maintaining the ability to use those variables in trustless computations.
The performance of this system is evaluated for two use cases to give a differentiated assessment in which cases the benefit of storing data off-chain outperforms the overhead added by the applied integrity check mechanism.
It is found that, although performance increases rely on the specific use case, off-chaining delivers the best result when for smart contracts which use large state variables and functions that change many state variables at once.
Finally, we present a concept of a translator which automatically transforms common smart contracts to use the presented off-chaining approach.
