\subsection{Blockchain}

A new concept for building effective and enormously scalable applications is developing. Bitcoin led this initiative back in 2008 with its open-source, peer-to-peer network, cryptographically-storing records (blockchain), and set number of tokens that power the utilization of its components. Blockchains being a mixture of various computing and economics concepts especially in financial sectors, including peer-to-peer systems, cryptography based, consensus protocols, decentralized storage, decentralized processing and smart contracts. The consolidation of these concepts makes blockchains as another innovation and as a programmable platform and system at the same time. Blockchains consist of specific properties including immutability and transparency of cryptographically-secured and peer-recorded transactions, which have been settled upon by consensus on the network. Being able to build up trustless interactions and business disintermediation continues to be one of the most important objectives of using blockchains.
