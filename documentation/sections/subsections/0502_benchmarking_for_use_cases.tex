\subsection{Benchmarking for Use Cases}

(Maybe start text fancy with the questions which araise during the project: see the benchmarking google sheet for that)

- What did we benchmark?

Explain which scenarios we did test (1 employee, multiple employee)

Explain under which aspects we did benchmark (gas, time)

Explain the thing with benchmarking only the overhead due to automining of ganache

Mention again why gas is of utmost importance to us (because it translates to money and time)

- Insert graphics / statistics

Explain what is visible

Explain what that does mean

- Ellaborate on conclusions and findings from this evaluation

What do all the statistics say? what do they mean to us?

When does Off-Chaining make sense?

Do we really save gas?

-> Conclude on that
