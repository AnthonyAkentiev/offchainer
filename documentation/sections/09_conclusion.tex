\section{Conclusion}

Taking into consideration our problem statement, by off-chaining data to a RDBMS while compromising blockchain properties as little as possible, we introduced an approach on how we can solve the problem at hand which makes sense for specific use cases. In this report we encouraged the necessity for off-chaining approaches to deal with limitations in the todayâ€™s blockchain developments, to broaden their usefulness and to reducing further usage costs. After deriving many challenges based on our experience during this project, we introduced two uses cases for moving computation and data off the blockchain, without compromising (or at least as possible) important blockchain properties, in particular, the trustlessness property.

We anticipate that in the future blockchain systems will continue development and enhance further concerning scalability and privacy issues by joining and implementing new concepts. Nevertheless, we keep considering off-chaining approaches to be crucial features in blockchain based application as they show additional functionality and possibly huge cost benefits.
