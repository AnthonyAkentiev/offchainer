\section{Evaluation}
In this section, we are going to discuss how our evaluation process looked like. We automatized the benchmarking, so our benchmarks are repeatable and easy to execute. The findings we made will also be discussed.

- Why is benchmarking so important in this project? Because we prototype and that is how we evaluate our prototype

- Maybe mention what we mean by ``Benchmarking'' ?

- Describe why gas cost and time is needed for that and why they make sense and what they do say (="aussagen")

\begin{itemize}
\item See \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KhEb6TT2YXKUlSJx2sdfR44ZhWUSHnXN}{Benchmarking strategy google sheet}
\item See what the results of those benchmarks are, make some nice figures out of them and put them in here
\item Evaluate / Conclude from those figures which findings were made
\end{itemize}
