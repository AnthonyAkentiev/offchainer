\section{Evaluation}
In this section, we are going to discuss how our evaluation process looked like. We automatized the benchmarking, so our benchmarks are repeatable and easy to execute. The findings we made will also be discussed.

\begin{itemize}
\item See \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KhEb6TT2YXKUlSJx2sdfR44ZhWUSHnXN}{Benchmarking strategy google sheet}
\item See what the results of those benchmarks are, make some nice figures out of them and put them in here
\item Evaluate / Conclude from those figures which findings were made
\end{itemize}
