\begin{itemize}
\item Blockchain new future technology, very important, etc.
\item Cite Jacobs paper here [\cite{Eberhardt2017}]
\item Mention transactions costs and the problems which araise from that (Maybe a new section \"{}Problems\"{}out of that, which comes after foundations, as we will need some foundations for that?)
\end{itemize}

TODO Introduction\\
Motivation/Problem Statement\\
Considering the execution time and cost related issues with the current development in blockchain, it has brought up the need for new approaches such as off-chaining the data and computation. By off-chaining the data and computation is meant by moving the data off the blockchain. By storing data to different databases, different server, or even including any third party, which certainly compromises the blockchain core “properties”. In any case, the key properties of blockchains and blockchain-based applications, might be at risk to various degrees while doing as such. All things considered, the framework ought to remain "trust-less" as in no unequivocal trust is required. Through this report we try to elaborate in depth our off-chaining implementation approach with minimal impact on compromising the blockchain properties.
