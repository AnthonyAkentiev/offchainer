\subsection{Make Middleware Trustless}

\subsection{Oraclize Approach to Save Gas}
During our research about alternative approaches to check the integrity of the off-chained data, we analyzed the Oracle provider Oraclize (see part 3.2) and found an approach that Oraclize uses to save gas costs which could present a further opportunity to extend this projectâ€™s system as well. By giving its users the choice whether to provide the proof that the data pushed by their Oracle is correct to the Smart Contract that requested the data in the first place and that may want to run the integrity check before actually using it or to store the proof for later use on a trustless database (IPFS) Oraclize can save its users a lot of gas in contrast to running the proof of correct data on-chain every time data is pushed to a Smart Contract. Accordingly, the presented system in this paper could provide its users with the same choice and further improve on its goal to save gas. At the same time, the integrity of the data can still be secured.

\subsection{Possible another integrity check mechanisms}
