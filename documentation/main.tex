\begin{abstract}

Blockchain technology is rising in significance. Many organizations in different industries, even though primarily in the Financial industry, have begun to explore the advantages of this revolutionary technology and how it benefits their businesses. The potential outcomes of the Blockchain are tremendous and it appears that any industry that uses some kind of transaction, can and will be disrupted by the Blockchain technology. With Blockchain’s based applications at core benefiting from blockchain’s properties of immutability and transparency, there are also costs to be considered. With today’s blockchain implementations, there are a few issues that need to be addressed such as storage capacities and data computation costs, performance and scalability issues. Through this research project, we tried to support the need for off-chaining approaches to overcome today’s blockchain limitations and to answer our research question on: “How can data used on-chain be outsourced to a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) without while compromising blockchain properties as little as possible”. Hence, we built a prototype as a proof-of-concept and analyzed on how well the capacities of our approach in Ethereum smart contracts are solving this problem. We find that using off-chaining approaches makes sense for specific use cases. Therefore, we introduced two use cases and analyzed our off-chaining reasoning further in this report. Moreover, we evaluated our implementation through detailed benchmarking results for our use-cases which support further our arguments on when it makes sense to use our off-chaining approach.

\section{Some examples to get started}

\subsection{How to add Comments}

Comments can be added to your project by clicking on the comment icon in the toolbar above. % * <john.hammersley@gmail.com> 2014-09-03T09:54:16.211Z:

To reply to a comment, simply click the reply button in the lower right corner of the comment, and you can close them when you're done.

\subsection{How to include Figures}

First you have to upload the image file from your computer using the upload link the project menu. Then use the includegraphics command to include it in your document. Use the figure environment and the caption command to add a number and a caption to your figure. See the code for Figure \ref{fig:frog} in this section for an example.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{images/frog.jpg}
\caption{\label{fig:frog}This frog was uploaded via the project menu.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{How to add Tables}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. 

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}

\subsection{How to write Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.


\subsection{How to create Sections and Subsections}

Use section and subsections to organize your document. Simply use the section and subsection buttons in the toolbar to create them, and we'll handle all the formatting and numbering automatically.

\subsection{How to add Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

You can upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with JabRef; or import your \href{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}{Mendeley}, CiteULike or Zotero library as a \verb|.bib| file. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

You can find a \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.

We hope you find Overleaf useful, and please let us know if you have any feedback using the help menu above --- or use the contact form at \url{https://www.overleaf.com/contact}!
